      <description>Hello, and welcome to my blog! I&amp;rsquo;m an Unreal Engine developer with a strong focus on networking and gameplay systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the engine for a little under three years, with a strong focus on gaining as much knowledge as I can. I&amp;rsquo;ve shifted a majority of my focus to learning more advanced networking techniques, and lately as been a focus on the Gameplay Ability System.&#xA;Beyond development, I&amp;rsquo;m an avid gamer, deeply inspired by the intricate worlds and narratives of classics like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.</description>
