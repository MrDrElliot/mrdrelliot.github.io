      <title>Blueprint vs C&#43;&#43;: Different Tools for Different Jobs</title>

      <description>C++ Is Not Better Than Blueprint—They’re Just Different You’ve probably heard the argument before: “C++ is better than Blueprint.” Often, this comes from people who are new to using C++ in Unreal Engine and are riding the peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect.&#xA;The truth is, one isn’t better than the other—they’re just different. It’s like comparing a knife to a fork; they are different tools for different jobs. Claiming that C++ is superior to Blueprint, comes across as arrogant.</description>

      <description>Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that is deeply embedded in the design of Unreal Engine, and in many cases, it&amp;rsquo;s an elegant and powerful tool. However, like any tool, it can be overused, leading developers into a trap that can complicate development and maintenance in the long run.&#xA;The Trap of Overusing Inheritance Inheritance is often the go-to solution for sharing functionality across different classes. While it provides a straightforward way to extend and modify behavior, over-relying on it can lead to a rigid and tightly coupled codebase.</description>

      <title>The dangers of Lambdas</title>

      <description>Using Lambdas in Unreal can be dangerous! Lambdas, or anonymous functions, in Unreal Engine can be very useful for writing concise and flexible code. However, they come with certain dangers, particularly when dealing with the lifetime of objects and capturing variables by reference. Here’s why:&#xA;1. Capturing by Reference and Object Lifetimes When you use lambdas in Unreal Engine, you might capture variables by reference, which is common for avoiding unnecessary copying.</description>
