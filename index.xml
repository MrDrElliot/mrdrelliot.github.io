      <title>Templated Object Types</title>

      <description>Unreal Engine provides various templated object pointer types that help manage memory and references to UObject instances in a safe and efficient manner. These templated types are vital for ensuring the stability and performance of your Unreal Engine projects. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the most common templated object pointer types, explain what they do, and discuss when to use them.&#xA;1. TObjectPtr&amp;lt;&amp;gt; Purpose: TObjectPtr is a smart pointer introduced in Unreal Engine 5, designed to replace raw pointers for referencing UObject types.</description>

      <title>What Are Soft References?</title>

      <description>What Are Soft References? Soft references are a way to reference an object in Unreal Engine without forcing it to stay in memory. This can be incredibly useful in scenarios where you need to reference assets like textures, sounds, or even entire levels, but don’t want to load them into memory until absolutely necessary.&#xA;Why Use Soft References? Imagine your game has a massive library of assets. Loading everything at once would quickly consume your memory, leading to performance issues or, worse, crashing your game.</description>

      <title>Blueprint vs C&#43;&#43;: Different Tools for Different Jobs</title>

      <description>C++ Is Not Better Than Blueprint—They’re Just Different You’ve probably heard the argument before: “C++ is better than Blueprint.” Often, this comes from people who are new to using C++ in Unreal Engine and are riding the peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect.&#xA;The truth is, one isn’t better than the other—they’re just different. It’s like comparing a knife to a fork; they are different tools for different jobs. Claiming that C++ is superior to Blueprint, comes across as narcissistic.</description>

      <title>Working With Buffers</title>
      <link>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/memory/buffers/</link>

      <description>In Unreal Engine, buffers are simply containers of bytes that can store raw data using memory offsets. Understanding how to effectively manage these buffers is essential for tasks like serialization, deserialization, and data storage.&#xA;Raw C++ Buffer Management In raw C++, managing buffers and packing data requires manual handling of memory offsets. For example, consider the following code that packs several uint32_t values into a std::vector&amp;lt;std::byte&amp;gt; buffer:&#xA;#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;cstdint&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;cstring&amp;gt; // For std::memcpy void PackData() { // Buffer to hold the packed data std::vector&amp;lt;std::byte&amp;gt; buffer; // Example data std::vector&amp;lt;uint32_t&amp;gt; data = { 1234, 5678, 91011 }; // Calculate the total size needed for the buffer size_t totalSize = data.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to my blog! I&amp;rsquo;m an Unreal Engine developer with a strong focus on networking and gameplay systems. With over three years of experience working in the engine, I&amp;rsquo;ve honed my skills in C++ and C, crafting efficient and scalable solutions for real-time multiplayer experiences.&#xA;Beyond development, I&amp;rsquo;m an avid gamer, deeply inspired by the intricate worlds and narratives of classics like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. My favorite movie is John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s The Thing (1982), a masterclass in tension and atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Network Serialization</title>

      <description>Hello, I wanted to talk about some ways you can improve networking performance in C++ by understanding and implementing efficient network serialization in Unreal Engine. Effective serialization is critical for transmitting data across the network without unnecessary overhead, especially in multiplayer games where bandwidth is limited.&#xA;This article assumes basic familiarization with Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s networking system.&#xA;What is Network Serialization? Serialization in the context of networking refers to the process of converting data into a format that can be easily transmitted over a network and reconstructed later.</description>
