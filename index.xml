      <description>Understanding TArray Allocators in Unreal Engine Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s TArray is a powerful and flexible container that allows you to manage dynamic arrays in your code. One of its lesser-known yet incredibly useful features is the ability to specify custom allocators. These allocators determine how the memory for the array is allocated and managed, which can have a significant impact on performance, especially in memory-constrained environments.&#xA;I personally highly recommend taking a look at the VoxelCore library that&amp;rsquo;s open source on Github, they wrote lots of incredibly performant containers that are worth a lot at.</description>

      <description>Unreal Engine provides various templated object pointer types that help manage memory and references to UObject instances in a safe and efficient manner. These templated types are vital for ensuring the stability and performance of your Unreal Engine projects. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the most common templated object pointer types, explain what they do, and discuss when to use them.&#xA;1. TObjectPtr&amp;lt;&amp;gt; Purpose: TObjectPtr is a smart pointer introduced in Unreal Engine 5, designed to replace raw pointers for referencing UObject types.</description>

      <title>What Are Soft References?</title>
      <link>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/memory/softreferences/</link>

      <description>What Are Soft References? Soft references are a way to reference an object in Unreal Engine without forcing it to stay in memory. This can be incredibly useful in scenarios where you need to reference assets like textures, sounds, or even entire levels, but don’t want to load them into memory until absolutely necessary.&#xA;Why Use Soft References? Imagine your game has a massive library of assets. Loading everything at once would quickly consume your memory, leading to performance issues or, worse, crashing your game.</description>

      <title>Blueprint vs C&#43;&#43;: Different Tools for Different Jobs</title>

      <description>C++ Is Not Better Than Blueprint—They’re Just Different You’ve probably heard the argument before: “C++ is better than Blueprint.” Often, this comes from people who are new to using C++ in Unreal Engine and are riding the peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect.&#xA;The truth is, one isn’t better than the other—they’re just different. It’s like comparing a knife to a fork; they are different tools for different jobs. Claiming that C++ is superior to Blueprint, comes across as arrogant.</description>

      <description>Simple way to possibly increase some performance. This blog is a follow-up to this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-VZoXn8f9U&#xA;Consider the following code:&#xA;// ConstexprExample.cpp : This file contains the &amp;#39;main&amp;#39; function. Program execution begins and ends there. // #include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt; int Fibonacci(int n) { if (n &amp;lt;= 1) return n; return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2); } constexpr int Fibonacci_C(int n) { if (n &amp;lt;= 1) return n; return Fibonacci_C(n - 1) + Fibonacci_C(n - 2); } int main() { auto Start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now(); constexpr int num = 25; constexpr int result_c = Fibonacci_C(num); std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;#34;Constexpr Fibonacci: &amp;#34; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; result_c &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;; std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;#34;Time Taken: &amp;#34; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::chrono::duration_cast&amp;lt;std::chrono::microseconds&amp;gt;(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - Start).</description>

      <title>Overuse of Inheritence, alternatives.</title>
      <link>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/general/inheritenceoveruse/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 13:46:48 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/general/inheritenceoveruse/</guid>
      <description>Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that is deeply embedded in the design of Unreal Engine, and in many cases, it&amp;rsquo;s an elegant and powerful tool. However, like any tool, it can be overused, leading developers into a trap that can complicate development and maintenance in the long run.&#xA;The Trap of Overusing Inheritance Inheritance is often the go-to solution for sharing functionality across different classes. While it provides a straightforward way to extend and modify behavior, over-relying on it can lead to a rigid and tightly coupled codebase.</description>

      <title>The dangers of Lambdas</title>
      <link>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/general/lambdadangers/</link>

      <guid>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/general/lambdadangers/</guid>
      <description>Using Lambdas in Unreal can be dangerous! Lambdas, or anonymous functions, in Unreal Engine can be very useful for writing concise and flexible code. However, they come with certain dangers, particularly when dealing with the lifetime of objects and capturing variables by reference. Here’s why:&#xA;1. Capturing by Reference and Object Lifetimes When you use lambdas in Unreal Engine, you might capture variables by reference, which is common for avoiding unnecessary copying.</description>

      <title>Working With Buffers</title>
      <link>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/memory/buffers/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 12:28:45 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mrdrelliot.github.io/memory/buffers/</guid>
      <description>In Unreal Engine, buffers are simply containers of bytes that can store raw data using memory offsets. Understanding how to effectively manage these buffers is essential for tasks like serialization, deserialization, and data storage.&#xA;Raw C++ Buffer Management In raw C++, managing buffers and packing data requires manual handling of memory offsets. For example, consider the following code that packs several uint32_t values into a std::vector&amp;lt;std::byte&amp;gt; buffer:&#xA;#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;cstdint&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;cstring&amp;gt; // For std::memcpy void PackData() { // Buffer to hold the packed data std::vector&amp;lt;std::byte&amp;gt; buffer; // Example data std::vector&amp;lt;uint32_t&amp;gt; data = { 1234, 5678, 91011 }; // Calculate the total size needed for the buffer size_t totalSize = data.</description>

      <description>Hello, I wanted to talk about some ways you can improve networking performance in C++ by understanding and implementing efficient network serialization in Unreal Engine. Effective serialization is critical for transmitting data across the network without unnecessary overhead, especially in multiplayer games where bandwidth is limited.&#xA;This article assumes basic familiarization with Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s networking system.&#xA;What is Network Serialization? Serialization in the context of networking refers to the process of converting data into a format that can be easily transmitted over a network and reconstructed later.</description>
